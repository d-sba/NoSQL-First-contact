# NoSQL-First-contact

With this project I've gotten a first glimpse into NoSQL databases and how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations.

Given a movies dataset, I've tried to answer a fictitious company question: How can we make a succesful movies?

Thus, taking a look at the data and different metrics (number of nominations, user score...) I answered where the movie should be filmed, which genre should the be and who to cast.

It's been a great way to put into practice what I learned in my master's degree.
